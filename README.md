# Random-password-generator
The random password generator is a browser application that allows the user to generate a random password based on some prerequisites that they decide such as the length of the password, if there are numbers and capital letters as well as special characters. 

# User Story
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security.

## Requirements 

- when clicking the button to generate a random password
  user is prompted with password criteria they can select

- when prompted with length of the password user can choose
  a length between 8 and 128 characters 

- when asked for character types to be included in password
  user can adjust to have/not have lowercase, uppercase,
  numeric, and/or special characters

- when each prompt is answered then input is validated 
  and at least one character type is selected 
  (add a "you must select  at least one" message)

- when all prompts are answered the password is generated 
  and matches criteria 

- when the password is generated the password is either
  given as an alert (top of browser) or on the screen
  in the text box

# Process and tools used 
For this project I utilized HTML and some simple CSS for the basic design of the website itself and I used Javascript to control the background processes and recieve the inputs that the user decides on in order to generate their unique password.
